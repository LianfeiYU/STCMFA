# STCMFA

This folder concludes the code and data of our STCMFA model: Spatial-Temporal Combination and Multi-head Flow-Attention Network for traffic flow prediction.

## Structure

data: the PeMS03, PeMS04, PeMS07, and PeMS08 datasets are used in our experiments, which are released by and available at [STCMFA_datasets.rar](https://pan.baidu.com/s/1lo35j2frch0n1adoU6UZvA?pwd=0000) with code: 0000.

experiments: store the trained model and the data generated by the experiment.

visualization: including the visualization program in our experiments.

## Requirements

Python 3.8.16, Pytorch 2.0.0, Numpy 1.20.0.

To replicate the experimental results of STCMFA, you can run "run.py" after the code and the above environment configuration are completed. After the program runs, you will get the trained model and the generated data in the "experiments" folder.
